#  Things we do wrong
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - We don't use just the git plumbing commands.
 - We can't derive testing coverage because we arent strictly module based.

#  TODO
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GIT-COLLAB
 [X] - should have an option to create a local branch
 [X] - add menu
 [X] - We shouldnt need to pass the server name as an argument.  It should be put together by the calling script
 [ ] - should be able to take in a number of remotes, branches, and commit ids so that it can merge a bunch of work into one local repo
 [X] - should make sure they are actually on the local branch
 [X] - The local branch should be temporary or created like [branchname]_REVIEW_BRANCH
 [ ] - Should display the repo we are in
 [ ] - Should keep track of the patches in one file
 [ ] - 

GIT-BULK
 [X] - add multi threading
 [X] - add support for non-git flags to git-bulk itself
 [X] - add support for following symlinks
 [X] - The repo that gets printed should be generated from a pwd not some fake concatination so that we know where we really are.
 [X] - Create a config file to go in the directory that contains all of your git repos called .gitbulk.
	   When git-bulk runs it should look up for that file. If it finds it then it knows that it can run there.
 [X] - .gitpgd should also be able to contain exclude directories
 [X] - find should send its errors to dev/null

GIT-PGD
 [X] - Should have include and exclude directories
 [ ] - Should check for multiple .gitpgd files

GIT-GANK
 [ ] - Need to check for the success or failure of the ssh connection
