=head1 NAME

B<git-fix-remotes> - Update a git repo's remotes to match defined patterns

=head1 SYNOPSIS

git fix-remotes [ options ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This will take a look at all the remotes of your git repo and the git-fix-remotes.conf configuration file.  Any remotes that match the parameters of the (mysteriously undocumented) configuration file will be run through the "patterns" enabled as described below.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -v

Extra verbosity

=item -n

Print what would be done but do not actually make any changes

=head1 PATTERNS

=over 4

=item prefer_pull_git

Switch to using Git protocol to pull changes.  This is generally happier for the network and the SSH subsystem of the central git server.

=item prefer_push_ssh

Switch to using SSH protocol to push changes.  This is required since we don't enable pushes via git://.  This is present in case someone does a repo clone via git protocol.

=back

=head1 TODO

    [ ] Document syntax of configuration file
    [ ] Add patterns for fixing shared NFS /home dirs and useless local SSHing
    [ ] Add smarts to deal with tilde path expansion (on remote servers too)
    [ ] Add some tests, that would be good eh?
    [ ] Add command line options to limit action to certain remotes

=head1 BUGS

Program flow is not well organized.  Sorry.

Things like port numbers and ssh usernames in remote URLs are currently ignored
