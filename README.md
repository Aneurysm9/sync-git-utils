Synacor git Utilities
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/synacorinc/sync-git-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/synacorinc/sync-git-utils)

The Synacor git Utilites are a set of git commands developed for use internally
at Synacor that we felt might be useful for the community at large.  The primary utility
in this set is `git-bulk`, which allows the execution of a git command across multiple
repositories in a common root.  This is incredibly useful if you work with a large number
of repositories and want to check them all out to a common branch or push a set of changes
across several repositories to a set of matching remote repositories.
